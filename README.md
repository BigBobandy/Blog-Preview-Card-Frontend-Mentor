## My process

HTML Structure: Created HTML elements based on the design images, focusing on the correct layout and placement.

Mobile-First CSS: Started styling with a mobile-first approach. I used Chrome's DevTools to set the site into mobile mode, ensuring everything looked good on smaller screens.

Responsive Design: Once satisfied with the mobile view, I introduced media queries to adapt the layout for larger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project, although beginner-friendly, was an excellent opportunity for me to solidify my understanding of key web development concepts. One of the most significant areas I focused on was media queries in CSS. This aspect of responsive design is something I've been eager to master, and through this project, I've gained a much clearer understanding and practical experience.

### Continued development

In my future projects, I want to focus heavily on mastering responsive web design. Ensuring that a site looks good and functions well on any screen size is crucial, and it's an area I've always found challenging. I plan to delve deeper into CSS frameworks, media queries, and flexible layouts to build more fluid and adaptable web pages.

Additionally, I aim to improve my skills in translating designs into functional web pages. This involves taking a design concept, whether it's an image, a sketch, or a digital design, and accurately converting it into a working website. To sharpen these skills, participating in challenges on platforms like Frontend Mentor will be a key part of my learning process. These challenges provide practical experience in implementing complex designs and help bridge the gap between design and development in real-world scenarios.
